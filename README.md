# Raytracing with OpenGL debugging

Ray Tracing is one of the oldest techniques for representing three-dimensional graphics. Due to its relatively high computational  requirements, it has been ignored in favor of rasterization in many real-time applications of ray tracing. Recently, with the new interest in real-time ray tracing due to hardware vendormarketing such as NVIDIA's RTX-series video cards, real-time ray tracing may be an achieveable goal in the coming years.

Beyond real-time ray tracing, many animation studios and production houseshave utilized ray-tracing for static images for a long time. A single image is then rendered, and a movie can be created by stitching these images together. Numerous other examples of applications of ray tracing exist.

## Goal

The goal is to develop a full raytracer that generates static images from a virtual scene containing lights, objects and a camera.
